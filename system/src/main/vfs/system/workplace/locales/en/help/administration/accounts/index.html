      <content><![CDATA[<P>This view allows to edit users as well as groups. The security model of 
OpenCms 6.0 is based upon users, groups and resources / tools.&nbsp;A resource 
(e.g. a page or some other file) only grants access to special groups. A tool 
(this is representing some action that a user wants to perform on OpenCms) does 
this too. </P>
<P>On the other hand a user has to be member of a sufficient group if he / she 
wants to use tools or access resources. </P>
<P>Furthermore user data is used for other tasks as well like send emails or 
broadcast messages to (in the workplace tools view). </P>
