projcect called "Offline". This project implicitly includes all your available 
pages and folders. Out of this project you are able to "direct - publish" 
all your created or modified pages and folders. You may also publish the 
complete offline project. But for larger websites this may publish more 
resources than you might have control (or knowledge about their validity) 
over.<br ><br ></span><span lang="DE-CH">Subprojects 
allow to split the work on a&nbsp; website amongst several authors or to work on 
different subparts independently. For instance you serve a standard site with 
stable content. You often do minor changes like fixing writing errors or adding 
some news. In a subproject you are able to add completely new parts that are 
bigger and take longer to get stable. In this way it is possible to publish the 
"Offline" project more frequently while having time to work on the bigger new 
parts.&nbsp;</span></FONT></P>

published it will not publish any&nbsp;pages that are part of other projects 
regardless of the fact that the pages of these other projects are in folders 
below the "Offline" project's root. </FONT></SPAN></P>
